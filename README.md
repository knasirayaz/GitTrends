# GitTrends

# Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to build a simple single screen app which shows the current
trending Github repositories fetched from a public API. The design and business
specifications have been provided below.


# App Requirements
1) Android using Kotlin as the development language and supporting min API level 21 (Lollipop)
2) Use Git as you would on a normal production project to show code history and development
3) The app should fetch the trending repositories from the provided public API and display it to the users
4) Assume API calls have a cost per call and that in general slightly stale data is ok - but users should be able to see current data when required.
5) Shimmer animation on the table cell while api is fetching
6) Dark mode support (for bonus points)
